# Math 270 Honors Project
**Authored by Malcolm McSwain**

The goal of this project is to provide a relatively simple but comprehensive understanding of the mathematics, with a foundation in linear algebra and multivariable calculus, and computation, handled by the TensorFlow Layers API, required for designing, compiling, training, and testing neural networks.

## Conceptual Framework

Neural networks are essentially complex mathematical "objects" that can be thought of as a multi-layered function. In the perceptron, the quintessential feedforward neural network, individual nodes have a numerical state that represents the weighted sum of previous nodes, plus a bias.
